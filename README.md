# xManager (Spotify)

A spotify manager application where you can download all modified versions of the spotify app itself.

# About The Project

The successor of our previous manager app called "xSpotify Manager" that was released way back 2020 developed by xC3FFF0E and with the help of Sherlock Holmes.

xC3FFF0E decided to create an app where people can easily download and install all modified versions of the spotify app from their devices. Our aim is to make a simple yet very useful manager app where people can easily understand how to use or to operate things from downloading to installing the modified .apks.
