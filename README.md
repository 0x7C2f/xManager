# xManager (Spotify)

A manager application where you can download all modified versions of the spotify app.

# About The Project

The successor from our previous manager app called "xSpotify Manager" that was released way back 2020 developed by xC3FFF0E and with the help of Sherlock Holmes.

xC3FFF0E decided to create an app where people can easily download and install all modified versions of the spotify app from their devices.  

Our aim is to make a simple yet very useful manager app for everyone's convenience. On this second version of the manager app, we added a couple of features such as the ability to uninstall, open the app's settings directly, clear the offline cached datas and launch the app. We hope that all users find these newly added features very useful.
